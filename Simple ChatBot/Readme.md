## LangChain + Google Gemini PDF Q&A (with Streamlit)

This is a small project that shows how to use Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash model together with LangChain and Streamlit.
The app lets you:

Upload a PDF

Ask natural language questions about it

Get answers generated by Gemini

Clear the chat easily

Choose between a Normal Answer or a Short Summary

Itâ€™s like having an AI assistant that can read your PDF and explain it to you in plain English. ðŸš€

## How it Works

You upload a PDF (for now, it should be text-based PDFs, not scanned images).

The app extracts text from the PDF using pypdf.

Your question + the PDF text are sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash through LangChain.

The response is displayed inside the Streamlit app.

You can clear everything (input + output) with a single button.
